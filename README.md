Introduction

Traditional market segmentation methods rely on manual feature engineering and predefined rules, making them inefficient for handling complex, high-dimensional customer data. This project uses deep clustering techniques like:

Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC)

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with K-Means


By applying these techniques, we achieve high-accuracy customer segmentation and optimize business strategies through better targeting and personalized marketing.
